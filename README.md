# Paper Bag
## Simple website for paper bag raffles with fun animations. 

Having a hard time making decisions? Is the world full of them and you are not ready to face them? This project allows you to make paper bag drawings in a fast, simple and fun way. 
I made this project to practice vanilla JS and more complex CSS animations.
